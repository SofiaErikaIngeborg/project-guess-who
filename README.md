# Project Guess Who 

This weeks assignment was to create a Guess Who game using JavaScript, practising objects, arrays and functions.

## The problem

This week I went through the project step by step, I have tested a lot of different solutions and managed to finally make the game work as intended. If I had more time I would create a timer for the game, added some sound effects and/or animations for each answer and also I would have changed the characters to a completely different theme.
